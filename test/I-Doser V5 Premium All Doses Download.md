## Installing the FSLabs A320-232 SAA Livery
 
To install the FSLabs A320-232 SAA Livery, you will need to copy the texture folder into your FSLabs A320-X aircraft folder. The default location for FSX is: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Games\Microsoft Flight Simulator X\SimObjects\Airplanes\FSLabs A32X`. The default location for P3D is: `C:\Program Files\Lockheed Martin\Prepar3D v4\SimObjects\Airplanes\FSLabs A32X`.
 
After copying the texture folder, you will need to edit the aircraft.cfg file to add a new entry for the livery. You can use any text editor to do this, such as Notepad. The aircraft.cfg file is located in the same folder as the texture folder. You will need to find the last [fltsim.X] section and copy it. Then paste it below and change the X to the next number in sequence. For example, if the last section is [fltsim.9], you will change it to [fltsim.10]. Then edit the title, texture, atc\_id, and ui\_variation lines to match the livery. For example:

    [fltsim.10]
    title=FSLabs A320-232 IAE SAA ZS-SZJ
    sim=SL_A32XX
    model=IAE
    panel=
    sound=
    texture=SAA ZS-SZJ
    kb_checklists=AirbusA321_check
    kb_reference=AirbusA321_ref
    atc_id=ZS-SZJ
    atc_airline=SOUTH AFRICAN
    atc_flight_number=1123
    ui_manufacturer="FSLabs"
    ui_type="A320-232 IAE"
    ui_variation="South African Airways ZS-SZJ"
    ui_typerole="Commercial Airliner"
    ui_createdby="Flight Sim Labs Ltd."
    description="FSLabs A320-232 IAE in South African Airways' current livery.\nThis airframe, ZS-SZJ (MSN 6478), was delivered to the airline on the 27th of February 2015.\nRepaint by Daniel Du Preez."
