# How to Get a Serial Number for Pipe Flow Wizard Software
 
Pipe Flow Wizard is a software that helps engineers and technicians to calculate flow rate, pressure drop, pipe diameter and pipe length for liquids and gases flowing in pipes. It is a useful tool for designing and optimizing pipe systems, as well as troubleshooting existing ones.
 
However, to use the full features of Pipe Flow Wizard, you need a valid serial number that activates the software license. Without a serial number, you can only use the software in trial mode, which limits the number of calculations and the pipe database.
